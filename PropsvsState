Props are readonly -> they are available from parent to child componenets (top down uidirectional)
Props are Immutable meaning they can not be changed. 

State : on the other hand,(The state is a javascript object that lives inside a each component, we can access it using this.) 
Every componet have state object, in treditional front end scenarios, 
You need to update the DOM. In react you need to update the State object (OR STATE OF A COMPONENT) so that the background
work or rendering will be handled by REAct.
