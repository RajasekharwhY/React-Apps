1. Alwasy name your component with Uppercase letter
2. react has a special function named useState()it is going to return two itmes for us
the first Item is a state object and second item is a function to change that state object

3. The state object can be anything like number, string, array or any object. 
for our example we use state object as number (with variable name counter, and upating furnciton name 
as setCounter
4. Since Javascript functions retun only one value counter and setCounter variables are returned in an Arry
const [counter, setCounter] = useState();

5. to understand above feature you need to understand Javascript destructing feature to capture these 
two variables (counter, setCounter) in one line.
6. useState has input parameter, which we use to set Initial value of state. in our example we use 0.
7. Jsx supports dynamic expression {} to display the variable values.
8. to use the setCounter function, every time we click or respond to any event, we need to introduce 
event handler, this looks similar like DOM API.. ..unlike javascript eventhandler
