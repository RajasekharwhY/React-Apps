One way not to do is 
by assigning the component state directly 

this.state.showComments = true; (you should not do this)
will not work

right way to do is
==========================================
this.setState({showComments : true}) 
==========================================
--> passing object
show comments to True. This will update the 
shwo componet property and rerender the component.

calling setState only replace the properties whcih are 
passed as a orguments. and not replace the entire
state object.
