The ablility to reference a specific instance of a local binding in an enclosing scopeâ€”is called closure.Below example explains this 
scenario.
// Example 

function division(factor)
{
   return (number) => number*factor;
}

// division is called and creates 
// an environment in which its 
// factor parameter is bound to 0.5,
// The function value it returns, which is stored in half
let half = division(0.5); 


// division is called and creates 
// an environment in which its 
// factor parameter is bound to 0.25
// // The function value it returns, which is stored in quarter
let quarter = division(0.25);


// remembers this environment. So when that is called, 
// it multiplies its argument by 0.5.
console.log(half(5));     // result is 2.5, 

// remembers this environment. So when that is called, 
// it multiplies its argument by 0.25.
console.log(quarter(5));  // result is 1.25
