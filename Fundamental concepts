Three simple concepts to understnad 
1.Components:
-------------
In react we Describe user Interfaces with components. (Javascipt functions).
The components are just like funcitons they take some input and out put some thing just like functions.
Components they recieve some input objects and they output the description of a user interface. We can re use the single
components in multiple user interfaces.
And a component can contain other components. 

You don't Invoke react component, You just use it in your html as a regualr html component.
